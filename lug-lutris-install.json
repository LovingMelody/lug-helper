      "notes": "Performance may be choppy for the first couple minutes after visiting a new place or performing a new activity while shaders compile. Subsequent arrival should not be choppy.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a Runtime Error you can continue using Star Citizen by dragging the dialog box to the side, but in-game VoIP and FoIP will cease to function until Star Citizen is restarted. Drop in to the LUG group's chat and forums; we have custom runners to work around this problem.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have all Wine dependencies properly installed or your game may crash during start-up. See our wiki linked above for more information and instructions.\r\n\r\nTo prevent crashes in areas with lots of geometry, the game needs a Linux resource limit named \"vm.max_map_count\" increased. If you are following our Quick Start Guide and using our LUG Helper, the Preflight Check will do this for you. To set it manually, execute:\r\n\r\nsudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=16777216\r\n\r\nConsult your distro's documentation on how to set this permanently or ask a LUG member.\r\n\r\nSee you in the 'verse!",
